# CSS-Lorem
Quick Description:
Auto-fill placeholder text simply by adding a CSS class. No more trips to lorem ipsum generator sites!

More Details:
There are plenty of lorem ipsum generators online, but I find it time-consuming to visit the site, punch in my preferences, generate the text, and then copy and paste it into my site.

So, I had a simple idea: Create a CSS file which can be used to auto-fill a site with placeholder text. By including this CSS file on in-development sites, you can get all the lorem ipsum goodness you need wihtout breaking flow and leaving your dev environment.So

Note: Not unexpectedly, research has just proven that this idea is not unique and that there may even be an easier way to get lorem ipsum (see below). Still, I'd like to make this myself for the experience and fun of it. :)
 - What I'm doing has been done, to a degree, here: https://github.com/bzzrckt/lorem.css
 - Also, I learned that Emmet can add placeholder text. See http://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/lorem-ipsum/ for details. This is convenient, but I still think a CSS approach would make it easier to later get rid of the placeholder text. Rather than highlighting and deleting the Emmet generated text, you can do a find/replace to more easily remove all the CSS-lorem classes.
